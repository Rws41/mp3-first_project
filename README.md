# mp3-first_project

Hello,

This is just a basic mp3 player I made with python as a first project. The UI was created with Tkinter, playlist support with Sqlite3.

I would like to thank all the resources I used in making this including so many users on StackOverflow where previous questions were super helpful, as well as everyone who created all the libraries I use. Your documentation was massively helpful. Hopefully at this point it is just a matter of downloading the .exe and running it!
